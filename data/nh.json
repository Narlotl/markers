FOR SOME TIME, I WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE TRIANGULATION STATION, HOWEVER, PARTLY AT LEAST BECAUSE OF THE MEAGER AND INACCURATE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION.  FINALLY I CUT OUT SOME OF THE SMALL BIRCHES SO THAT I COULD SEE STATIONS MARK AND STRATHAM TALL CHURCH SPIRE IN LINE AND THEN, ON NOV. 23, 1930, I FOUND THE STATION.  IT WAS IN A CLUMP OF BIRCHES AND COVERED WITH LEAVES.  THE MARK SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CHIPPED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE DRILL HOLE HAD DISAPPEARED AND ONLY A PART OF THE TRIANGLE REMAINED.  THE STONE DID NOT IMPRESS ME AS BEING A STABLE OR SATISFACTORY STATION MARK, AND WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE TRIANGLE WAS ON THE EXTREME EDGE, WHICH SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS THE STONE HAD BEEN PARTLY ROTATED BY FROST ACTION OR OTHERWISE.  A SPLIT BOULDER, DOUBTLESS THE ONE REFERRED TO IN THE PRINTED DESCRIPTION HAS A 3-INCH TRIANGLE (NOT MENTIONED IN THE DESCRIPTION) CUT IN IT, THE TRIANGLE BEING ABOUT 86.4 FEET FROM THE STATION, ABOUT S 54 DEG W.  THIS BOULDER IS SUBSTANTIAL, BEING ABOUT 9 FEET LONG, NEARLY AS WIDE AND ABOUT 3 FEET HIGH.  THERE IS NO OTHER SPLIT BOULDER IN THE VICINITY, SO THIS MUST BE THE ONE DESCRIBED AS BEING ABOUT 60 FEET NE OF THE STATION, THE DISTANCE BEING APPARENTLY AN ERROR.  THE VERY TALL BOULDER MENTIONED IS ACTUALLY ABOUT 2-1/2 FEET HIGH, ABOUT 2-1/2 FEET IN DIAMETER AT THE BASE, AND MORE OR LESS CONICAL, WITH A 3 1/2-INCH TRIANGLE CUT IN THE TOP, BUT NOT MENTIONED IN THE DESCRIPTION.

BENJAMIN F. WEEKS, ABOUT 2,440 FEET ABOVE THE MEAN-SEA LEVEL.  THE ASCENT OF THE MOUNTAIN IS QUITE STEEP ON ALL SIDES, BUT LEAST STEEP ON THE WESTERN SLOPE WHERE A ROAD WAS CONSTRUCTED IN THE FALL OF 1859.  THE STATION IS MARKED BY A COPPER BOLT IN THE ROCK AT THE SUMMIT OF THE MOUNTAIN.  THE ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY WAS PLACED ABOUT 100 FEET TO THE NORTHWARD ON A BARE ROCK.  IN 1878 ANOTHER BOLT WAS PLACED 0.635 METER FROM THE STATION, N 88 DEG 45 MIN W.                            STATION RECOVERY (1931)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1931 (HSS) THE STATION IS ON WHAT IS KNOWN AS BELKNAP MOUNTAIN, THE NAME GUNSTOCK NOW BEING APPLIED TO A PEAK ABOUT 3/4 MILE TO THE NW.  I WENT TO THE MOUNTAIN ON SEPT. 29, 1931 AND FOUND NO COPPER BOLTS ON THE SUMMIT, BUT THERE WERE NUMEROUS DRILL HOLES, ONE OF WHICH I THOUGHT MIGHT BE THE STATION, AS THERE WAS ANOTHER HOLE 2.13 FEET E OF IT, WHICH WAS ABOUT 0.05 FEET GREATER THAN THE 0.635 METER GIVEN IN THE PRINTED DESCRIPTION. I STARTED TO MEASURE THE DISTANCES TO OTHER DRILL HOLES, BUT BECAME DISCOURAGED WHEN, IN A CASUAL SEARCH, I FOUND AT LEAST 21 OF THEM, WITHIN 50 FEET OR SO OF THE 2 HOLES MENTIONED ABOVE.  PROBABLY SOME OF THESE HOLES MAY BE REFERENCE OR RANGE HOLES, AND IF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THEM IS AVAILABLE I SHALL TRY TO VISIT THE MOUNTAIN AGAIN NEXT YEAR.  THE FIRE TOWER WAS A LITTLE W OF N AND ABOUT 44-1/2 FEET DISTANT FROM THE DRILL HOLE WHICH I THOUGHT MIGHT BE THE STATION, THIS DISTANCE BEING SOMEWHAT GREATER THAN WOULD BE INDICATED BY THE GEOGRAPHIC POSITION OF THE TOWER, WHICH WAS USED BY THE U.S.G.S. AS AN UNOCCUPIED STATION IN 1916-18. THERE IS A GOOD VIEW IN ALL DIRECTIONS FROM THE SUMMIT.  THE STATION MAY BE REACHED BY EITHER OF TWO TRAILS WHICH LEAD TO THE FIRE TOWER, ONE ON THE LACONIA SIDE AND THE OTHER ON THE NE SIDE.                            STATION RECOVERY (1932)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1932 (HSS) I RECOVERED THIS STATION ON JUNE 15, 1932, THE COPPER BOLT BEING STILL FIRMLY IN PLACE. THE BOLT HAD BEEN FOUND BY THE FIRE WATCHMAN, WHOSE INTEREST HAD BEEN AROUSED BY AN UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH WHICH I HAD MADE ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE, AND HE REPORTED THAT THE BOLT HAD BEEN COVERED WITH DIRT AND THAT IT HAD BEEN PARTLY HIDDEN BY A THIN LAYER OF CEMENT.  I NOTICED THE CEMENT ON THE LEDGE AROUND THE BOLT AND I FOUND A ROUGH CONCRETE BLOCK LYING NOT FAR AWAY.  THIS WAS ABOUT 2 FEET HIGH, WITH A TRIANGULAR BASE, AND IT HAD EVIDENTLY ONCE SERVED AS A MONUMENT CEMENTED OVER THE STATION.  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN WHO BUILT IT.  I REPLACED IT OVER THE BOLT, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL REMAIN IN PLACE, AS IT IS NOT FASTENED IN ANY WAY.  I FOUND ABOUT 40 DRILL HOLES, ALL BUT ABOUT 2 OF WHICH WERE WITHIN 50 FEET OF THE STATION, AND I IDENTIFIED 7 OF THESE AS BEING RANGE HOLES WHICH ARE SHOWN ON THE SKETCH IN THE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION OF THE STATION.  THE AZIMUTHS AND DISTANCES CHECKED NICELY.  I FOUND THE BOLT OF 1878, MENTIONED IN THE PRINTED DESCRIPTION, AND IT WAS RUSTY AND EVIDENTLY OF IRON.  THE CENTER OF THE STEEL FIRE TOWER IS, ACCORDING TO MY MEASUREMENTS, 56.45 FEET FROM THE STATION, IN AZIMUTH ABOUT 167-1/2 DEG, AND THIS FORMS A CONVENIENT WAY OF FINDING THE STATION.  THREE DRILL HOLES ARE QUITE NEAR THE STATION, AS FOLLOWS-- 1.52 FEET, 22-1/2 DEG.  1.62 FEET, 145 DEG.  2.46 FEET, 221 DEG.  THESE AZIMUTHS WERE DETERMINED ONLY VERY ROUGHLY, TO GIVE A GENERAL IDEA OF THE LOCATION OF THE HOLES.                            STATION RECOVERY (1933)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1933 (HSS) THIS NOTE IS SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE ONE WHICH I PREPARED IN 1932, SOON AFTER I RECOVERED THE STATION.  IN THAT NOTE I MENTIONED A CONCRETE MONUMENT WHICH I FOUND LYING NEAR THE STATION AND WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY ONCE BEEN PLACED OVER THE STATION. I WAS AT THAT TIME UNABLE TO LEARN WHO BUILT THE MONUMENT, BUT ON A RECENT VISIT TO THE WASHINGTON OFFICE I FOUND A RECORD WHICH SHOWED THAT IT HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED BY THE PARTY OF A.T. MOSMAN, IN 1897.  IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A PIER 4-1/2 FEET HIGH, ON WHICH A THEODOLITE HAD BEEN SUPPORTED, BUT THE PIECE WHICH I FOUND WAS ONLY ABOUT 2 FEET HIGH AND THEREFORE, ONLY A PART OF THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE.  THE PEAK ON WHICH THE STATION IS LOCATED IS NOW CALLED BELKNAP MOUNTAIN AND ANOTHER PEAK ABOUT 3/4 MILE TO THE NW IS CALLED GUNSTOCK MOUNTAIN.                            STATION RECOVERY (1958)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1958 (WER) STATION MARK, A COPPER BOLT WHICH IS SURROUNDED BY A TRIANGLE CHISLED IN THE OUTCROPPING BEDROCK WAS RECOVERED AND FOUND IN GOOD CONDITION.

A LARGE WATER TANK NOW COVERS THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THERE IS A POSIBILITY THAT THE SUMMIT WAS BLOWN OFF TO MAKE A SUITABLE FOUNDATION FOR IT.  NOTE--COPIED FROM A LETTER FROM T.P.

SHAW--THE STATION IS WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE MOUNTAIN AND MAY BE REACHED BY A PRIVATE TOLL ROAD ON THE E SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN, OR BY A COG RAILROAD ON THE W SIDE.  THE ROAD, 8 MILES LONG, IS USUALLY PASSABLE FOR AUTOMOBILES FROM ABOUT JUNE 1, UNTIL IT IS BLOCKED BY SNOW IN THE FALL, AND THE RAILROAD IS IN OPERATION DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS ONLY.  NEAR THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE MOUNTAIN IS A WOODEN WATER TANK, ABOUT 22 FEET IN DIAMETER AND 16 FEET HIGH, SUPPORTED ON HEAVY TIMBERS. THESE TIMBERS REST ON THE ROCK AND ON HEAVY BLOCKS, BETWEEN TWO OF WHICH THE BOLT CAN BE SEEN ABOUT 2 FEET UNDER THE TANK.  THE BOLT APPEARS TO BE FIRMLY IN PLACE AND A CROSS IS STILL DISCERNIBLE ON ITS ROUNDED HEAD.  A U.S.G.S. BENCH MARK, STAMPED 6284 FEET MARKS THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE ROCK AND THE BOLT BEARS A LITTLE S OF W FROM THE BENCH MARK, DISTANT AN INCH OR TWO MORE THAN 5 FEET, MEASURED ALONG THE SLOPE, THE ELEVATION OF THE BOLT BEING SOME 2 1/2 FEET BELOW THE BENCH MARK.  THESE MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE ONLY ROUGHLY, BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE TANK.  THE VIEW FROM THE VICINITY OF THE STATION IS OBSTRUCTED BY BUILDINGS AND BY THE TANK, EXCEPT FROM ABOUT WNW THROUGH N TO ABOUT ENE.  IN THE GENERAL VICINITY OF THE STATION I FOUND SEVERAL IRON BOLTS, WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE ONCE SERVED AS ANCHOR BOLTS FOR THE OLD OBSERVATORY OR FOR OTHER STRUCTURES.  AT THE TIME OF MY VISIT, JUNE 4, 1933, THE FOLLOWING BUILDINGS WERE ON THE SUMMIT--SUMMIT HOUSE, A WOODEN HOTEL.  TIP TOP HOUSE, WITH WALLS OF LOOSE STONES AND A WOODEN ROOF, CONNECTED WITH THE SUMMIT HOUSE BY A COVERED PASSAGEWAY.  CAMDEN COTTAGE, A WOODEN BUILDING USED AS A CAMP BY CLIMBERS.  STAGE OFFICE, ALSO OF WOOD, USED BY PATRONS OF THE AUTO ROAD AND ALSO OCCUPIED AS A METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATORY IN 1932-3, DURING THE INTERNATIONAL POLAR YEAR.  THERE IS ALSO A GARAGE JUST BELOW THE SUMMIT.  ALL THESE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN BUILT SINCE JUNE 1908, WHEN A FIRE SWEPT THE SUMMIT AND DESTROYED EVERYTHING BUT THE STONE WALLS OF THE TIP TOP HOUSE. THE OBSERVATORY, OR TOWER, WHICH WAS SITUATED OVER THE STATION FOR MANY YEARS, IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN PULLED DOWN IN 1902.                            STATION RECOVERY (1934)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1934 (KGC) THE COPPER BOLT MARKING THE STATION WAS FOUND AS DESCRIBED BY H.S. SHAW IN HIS NOTE OF 1933.  THE BOLT CHECKS THE DESCRIPTION OF C.C.Y., IN 1897 THE ONLY EXCEPTION NOTED WAS THAT IS SEEMS TO BE MORE NEARLY W THAN WNW (AS STATED IN HIS NOTE) FROM THE HIGHEST POINT ON THE MOUNTAIN, HOWEVER, ON ACCOUNT OF THICK WEATHER AN ACCURATE DIRECTION COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.  THE BOLT IS NOW UNDER A WOODEN WATER TANK.  THE TANK IS ABOUT 22 FEET IN DIAMETER AND 16 FEET IN HEIGHT AND IS SUPPORTED BY A CRIBBING OF 12- BY 12-INCH TIMBERS.  THE BOLT IS ABOUT 2 FEET UNDER THE NW SIDE OF THE TANK AND A PLUMB-BOB STRING SUSPENDED OVER IT CAN BE SEEN FROM SEVERAL PLACES ABOUT THE TANK.  THE BOLT IS 1 INCH IN DIAMETER, WITH SLIGHTLY FLATTENED HEAD AND WITH CROSS MARKS STILL VISIBLE ON IT.  IT PROJECTS ABOUT 1/4 INCH ABOVE THE ROCK AND IS IN A DEPRESSION IN THE ROCK 4-1/2 FEET NEARLY DUE W FROM THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE MOUNTAIN.  A U.S.G.S. BENCH MARK, E1. 6284 MARKS THE HIGHEST POINT, A SHARP-TOPPED BOULDER AS DESCRIBED BY C.C.Y., IN 1897.  THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN CONSISTS OF A MASS OF BOULDERS OF VARIOUS SIZES AND AT NO PLACE IS ONE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH SOLID LEDGE.  TO PRESERVE THE CENTER OF THE COPPER BOLT 3 STANDARD REFERENCE MARKS WERE INSTALLED, EACH ONE IN A LARGE BOULDER FIRMLY IMBEDDED IN THE GROUND.  FROM THESE REFERENCE MARKS THE CENTER MAY BE REPRODUCED BY THE ANGLES AND DISTANCES AS SHOWN ON THE FOLLOWING SKETCH.  IT IS LIKELY THAT A MORE PERMANENT WATER TANK MAY BE BUILT ON THE SUMMIT AND THE STATION MARK COVERED OR DESTROYED.  IN THAT CASE REFERENCE MARK NO. 3 CAN BE OCCUPIED AS AN ECCENTRIC STATION, IF IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REPRODUCE THE CENTER AND OCCUPY IT.  A 25-FOOT TOWER ON REFERENCE MARK NO. 3 WOULD CLEAR THE BUILDINGS AND TANK ON THE SUMMIT.  A CLEAR VIEW FROM THE GROUND AT REFERENCE MARK NO. 3 MAY BE HAD FROM ABOUT W TO ENE.  THE TOP OF THE TANK GIVES A CLEAR VIEW ALL AROUND THE HORIZON. THE SUMMIT OF THE MOUNTAIN IS READILY ACCESSIBLE DURING THE MONTHS JUNE TO OCTOBER BY PRIVATE TOLL ROAD AND COG RAILWAY.  NO TOLL WAS CHARGED FOR OUR VISIT.  DISTANCES SHOWN WERE MEASURED WITH STEEL TAPE IN METERS.  THE ANGLES SHOWN WERE MEASURED WITH A NEW ONE MINUTE TRANSIT.                            STATION RECOVERY (1943)  RECOVERY NOTE BY US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 1943 (GBG) RECOVERED AS DESCRIBED IN ORIGINAL AND VARIOUS RECOVERY NOTES.  THE REFERENCE MARKS ESTABLISHED IN 1934 WERE ALSO RECOVERED AND DISTANCES CHECKED.  A TACK WAS PLACED IN THE DECKING OVER THE TOP OF THE TANK DIRECTLY OVER THE STATION, BUT THE POINT WAS OCCUPIED ONLY FOR TURNING ANGLES TO THE U.S.G.S. STATION MT.

STATION RECOVERY (1958)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1958 (WER) THE STATION MARK AND ALL THREE REFERENCE MARKS AND THE USGS BM WERE RECOVERED AS DESCRIBED IN THE 1934 DESCRIPTION OF K.G.C..  ALL MARKS WERE FOUND TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION.  DUE TO A SECOND WATER TANK WHICH HAS BEEN BUILT JUST WEST OF THE WATER TANK MENTIONED IN THE 1934 DESCRIPTION, THE MARKS ARE NOW USELESS.  SINCE NONE OF THE MARKS COULD BE USED A MT WASHINGTON 3 WAS ESTABLISHED AT A POINT FROM WHICH A TIE COULD BE MADE TO THE OLD STATION.  A TRAVERSE CONNECTION WAS MADE FROM TRIANGULATION STATION MT WASHINGTON 3 TO TRIANGULATION STATION MT WASHINGTON 1877, DISTANCE BEING 81.54 FEET (24.852 METERS) SOUTHEAST OF STATION MT WASHINGTON 3.

THE STATION IS MARKED BY A 1/2-INCH IRON BOLT FIRMLY IMBEDDED IN THE ROCK, AT THE HIGHEST POINT.  THE NEAREST RAILROAD STATION IS LEE.  ABOUT 2 MILES FROM THE STATION IS AN OLD AND LITTLE USED ROAD WHICH TURNS TO THE LEFT UP A STEEP HILL FROM THE MAIN ROAD.  THIS ROAD LEADS TO A FARMHOUSE JUST S OF THE MOUNTAIN.

I FOUND THE IRON STATION-BOLT, THE 4 DRILL HOLES AND THE 3 BENT BOLTS.  THE STATION-BOLT IS BROKEN OFF FLUSH WITH THE LEDGE, HOWEVER, IT SEEMS TO BE FIRMLY IN PLACE.  I FOUND 3 OTHER DRILL HOLES WHICH ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE DESCRIPTION, ALTHOUGH THEY SEEMED TO BE AS OLD AS THE OTHERS.  ONE OF THESE HOLES, A SMALL ONE, IS 2.60 METERS FROM THE STATION, ABOUT S 17 DEG E, AND MAY HAVE SERVED TO MARK THE LINE TO GUNSTOCK.  ANOTHER, IN WHICH THERE ARE 3 SMALL IRON WEDGES, IS 2.25 METERS FROM THE STATION, ABOUT S 73 DEG W, AND THE THIRD IS 2.51 METERS, ABOUT S 74 DEG W AND MAY HAVE MARKED THE LINE TO AGAMENTICUS.

TABLET, IN A CONCRETE POST, WHICH WAS PLACED BY C.B. KENDALL, IN 1931.  ACCORDING TO THE FIRE WATCHMAN MR. KENDALL FAILED TO FIND THE STATION OF 1848, ALTHOUGH THEY DID CONSIDERABLE DIGGING.  U.S.G.S. BULLETIN 216 STATES THAT THE STATION WAS USED BY G.T. HAWKINS IN 1903.  BUT IN 1925 R.M. WILSON, OF THE U.S.G.S. FAILED TO FIND THE STATION WHEN HE DETERMINED THE POSITION OF THE FIRE TOWER, CALLING IT UNCANOONUC TOWER.  THE TYPEWRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF THE LATTER STATION IS IN PART AS FOLLOWS--THE STATION WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED BY THE U.S.C. AND G.S. AND MARKED BY A HOLE DRILLED IN SOLID ROCK.  THIS MARK COULD NOT BE FOUND IN 1925.  A HIGH STEEL FIRE LOOKOUT TOWER HAS BEEN ERECTED ON THE SUMMIT AND THE CENTER OF THIS TOWER MARKS THE LOCATION OF 1925.  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SEE OUT FROM THE GROUND.  THE OLD COAST SURVEY MARK IS PROBABLY ABOUT 2 FEET S AND 5 FEET W OF CENTER OF TOWER.  I VISITED UNCANOONUC MOUNTAIN (NOW USUALLY THUS SPELLED) TWICE DURING THE FALL OF 1932, BUT FAILED TO FIND THE OLD STATION. IT MAY STILL EXIST, HOWEVER, UNDER THE SURFACE, UNLESS IT WAS DESTROYED OR COVERED UP DURING THE BUILDING OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE TOWER.  THE VIEW FROM THE GROUND IS MOSTLY OBSTRUCTED BY TREES, BUT IS CLEAR IN ALL DIRECTIONS FROM THE OBSERVATION ROOM OF THE TOWER.

FROM THERE AN ELECTRIC CABLE RAILWAY RUNS TO WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE STATION.  THE RAILWAY IS OPERATED DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS (MAY 30 TO ABOUT NOVEMBER 1 IN 1932) AND THE TRIP TAKES BETWEEN 5 AND 10 MINUTES.  THE RAILWAY AND A SHORT PIECE OF ROAD LEADING TO IT ARE NOT SHOWN ON THE U.S.G.S. MILFORD SHEET (EDITION OF 1906) WHICH COVERS THE REGION.  THERE IS A TRAIL NEAR THE RAILWAY.  THE ROAD SHOWN ON THE MILFORD SHEET, ON THE WESTERLY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN, WAS ONCE A TOLL ROAD, BUT IS SAID TO BE NO LONGER PASSABLE FOR VEHICLES.                            STATION RECOVERY (1933)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1933 (HSS) ON OCTOBER 4, 1933, I FOUND A DRILL HOLE WHICH I THINK IS THE ONE WHICH MARKS THIS STATION, ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION, AS I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND ANY MENTION OF ANY REFERENCE MARKS, EITHER IN THE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION OR ELSEWHERE.  IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE U.S.G.S. STATION UNCANOONUC TOWER, OF 1925, IT IS STATED THAT THE OLD COAST SURVEY MARK IS PROBABLY ABOUT 2 FEET S AND 5 FEET W OF CENTER OF TOWER.  I BEGAN TO DIG AT ABOUT THAT POINT AND AFTER UNCOVERING A NUMBER OF SQUARE FEET OF THE LEDGE AND PROBING CAREFULLY WHERE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REMOVE ALL THE MOIST SOIL FROM THE VERY ROUGH SURFACE OF THE LEDGE, I FOUND THAT ABOVE-MENTIONED DRILL HOLE, ABOUT 2 FEET OR SO FROM THE POSITION GIVEN IN THE U.S.G.S. DESCRIPTION.  THE AGREEMENT MAY BE EVEN CLOSER, HOWEVER, AS I WORKED FROM THE CENTER OF THE SQUARE FORMED BY THE LEGS OF THE TOWER AND I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO PLUMB DOWN FROM THE TOP OF THE TOWER.  THE DRILL HOLE IS ONLY 1/2 TO 3/4 INCH DEEP, BUT IS DEFINITELY RECOGNIZABLE AS A DRILL HOLE, AND IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT A PIECE OF THE LEDGE HAS BEEN BROKEN OFF, LEAVING ONLY THE LOWER PART OF THE HOLE.  THE LEDGE IS COVERED WITH ABOUT 9 OR 10 INCHES OF SOIL AT THIS POINT.  THE DRILL HOLE IS 4.72 FEET (HORIZONTALLY) ABOUT 4-3/4 DEG N OF W FROM THE U.S.G.S. TABLET (UNSTAMPED) WHICH WAS SET IN 1931. THIS TABLET IS ABOUT 3 INCHES S OF THE INTERSECTION OF THE DIAGONALS OF THE SQUARE FORMED BY THE TOWER LEGS.  THE INFORMATION IN MY RECOVERY NOTE OF 1932 STILL APPLIES.
