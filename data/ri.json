I FOUND ONE PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE NAME BLISS CORNERS AND SHE APPLIED IT TO THE INTERSECTION OF THE ROAD FROM FALL RIVER TO ADAMSVILLE WITH AN E AND W ROAD WHICH SHE CALLED BULGAMARSH ROAD.  (HER SPELLING OF THIS WORD MAY NOT BE CORRECT.) THIS INTERSECTION IS ABOUT 5-1/2 MILES S OF THE CENTER OF THE CITY OF FALL RIVER, ABOUT 3-1/2 MILES E OF STONE BRIDGE OVER THE SAKONNET RIVER, AND ABOUT 0.7 MILE WESTWARD BY ROAD FROM THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN MASSACHUSETTS AND RHODE ISLAND.

BROWN AND IN THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF HIS PASTURE WHICH IS DIRECTLY SOUTHWEST OF HIS BARN AND IS SURROUNDED BY A STONE AND WIRE FENCE.  IT IS AT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF INDIAN HILL, 40 FEET EAST OF THE WEST STONE FENCE, AND 66.5 FEET NORTH OF THE SOUTH STONE FENCE AND 150 YARDS SOUTHWEST OF THE BARN BUILDINGS.  THE MARK, NOTE 3, PROJECTS ABOUT 2 INCHES ABOVE THE GROUND AND IS STAMPED INDIAN 1934.

THE AZIMUTH MARK IS THE NORTHWEST SPIRE AT THE ST. GEORGE SCHOOL ACROSS THE SAKONNET RIVER.  IT IS ABOUT 4 MILES WEST-SOUTHWEST OF THE STATION.  IT APPEARS AS THE RIGHT HAND ONE OF 4 SPIRES OF THE SAME HEIGHT ON THE SAME TOWER AND IS THE MOST PROMINENT LANDMARK IN THAT DIRECTION.  A 37-FOOT TOWER IS NEEDED TO SEE A 77-FOOT TOWER AT WARREN AND A 4-FOOT STAND AT SAKONNET.  A 4-FOOT STAND WILL SEE 4-FOOT STANDS AT SACHUEST (USE) AND PARADISE ROCK 2.

HEPBURN IS BUILDING A HOUSE WHICH WAS TO BE ON THE LOCATION OF TRIANGULATION STATION INDIAN 1934.  HE HAS VOLUNTEERED HOWEVER, TO MOVE THE HOUSE SUFFICIENTLY SO THAT THE MONUMENT WILL BE OUTSIDE THE LIMITS OF THE HOUSE, AND A TERRACE WILL BE BUILT FLUSH WITH THE MARK.                            STATION RECOVERY (1962)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1962 (CHO) RECOVERED STATION AS DESCRIBED, IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, 2 IN UNDER SURFACE OF GROUND, AND 3-1/2 IN BELOW TOP OF WELL-GROOMED LAWN.  INDIAN IS 3.65 FT. FROM S FACE OF THE CHIMNEY WHICH IS ON THE S SIDE OF MR. HEPBURNS HOUSE.  FROM SW CORNER OF THIS CHIMNEY, I MEASURED 1.90 FT. E, ALONG ITS S FACE.  THEN 3.65 FT. S TO STATION.  MR. HEPBURN SHOWED ME AN ARCHITECTS GROUND PLAN OF HIS HOUSE AND PROPERTY.  INDIAN IS PROPERLY SHOWN ON THIS PLAN.  HE GAVE ME PERMISSION TO DIG AND SEE THIS DISK.  R.M. 2 RECOVERED IN VERY GOOD CONDITION AS DESCRIBED BY W.D.P. 1934 AND P.L.B. 1940.  ROCK IS OF PUDDING STONE, AND IS S OF HIS DRIVEWAY.  R.M. 1 NOT RECOVERED, BUT IM QUITE SURE IT IS IN ORIGINAL POSITION.  FROM INDIAN, THE SW CORNER OF HEPBURNS HOUSE INTERFERES WITH DIRECT SIGHTING TO R.M. 1.  FROM STATION, I MEASURED AN OFFSET LINE E, TO CLEAR W FACE OF HEPBURNS HOUSE. THEN N 8 DEG E FOR 230.70 FT. TO A TEMPORARY E AND W LINE, ALONG WHICH WE MEASURED 35 FT. E FROM THE W STONE FENCE.  THIS POSITION, ON A WELL-KEPT LAWN, WAS WITHIN AN INCH OR TWO OF THE SPOT WHERE R.M. 1 SHOULD BE.  AND IS 9.75 FT. W OF THE VERTICAL CENTER OF THE S SCREEN DOOR ON THE W FACE OF HOUSE BELONGING TO MR. ALFRED STAPLETON (NEXT HOUSE N OF THE HEPBURNS).  THE LATTER TOLD ME THAT STAPLETON, IN GRADING, PUT ABOUT 5 IN OF TOPSOIL OVER THE BEDROCK WHERE R.M. 1 WAS.  I DID NOT DIG FOR THIS.  WE TELEPHONED STAPLETONS, BUT THEY WERE NOT HOME.  AZIMUTH MARK, ST. GEORGE SPIRE NW, PLAINLY SEEN FROM HEPBURN PROPERTY, BUT NOT FROM STATION, BECAUSE TREES INTERFERE.  CAREFUL PRUNING OF A FEW SMALL BRANCHES MIGHT CLEAR THE LINE OF SIGHT FROM STATION TO AZIMUTH MARK.  MR. HEPBURN PUT HIS TERRACE ON NW CORNER OF HIS HOUSE, AND NOT FLUSH WITH STATION WHICH IS ON S SIDE OF HIS HOUSE.  ORIGINAL PLAN, AS NOTED IN F.B.Q. 1956 REPORT (P. 17, DESCRIPTIONS), WAS CHANGED.  SIMPLEST TO REACH DIRECTIONS ARE IN W.D.P.S 1934 REPORT.  DELETE HIS LAST SENTENCE.  AFTER TURN N AND RUN 0.6 MILE PUT THE FOLLOWING--TO MAILBOX ON LEFT, MARKED HEPBURN.  HERE TURN W ON PRIVATE ROAD LEADING TO HEPBURN HOUSE AND STATION.  W.D.P.S 1934 REPORT, INDIAN HILL IS KNOWN LOCALLY, AS SUCH.  BUT ONLY OLD-TIMERS KNOW THE BROWN FARM AND PROPERTY OF W. BROWN.  NO BROWNS LIVE HERE NOW, AND PROPERTY HAS BEEN SOLD, IN ONE ACRE, AND TWO OR MORE ACRE PLOTS, ON WHICH A NUMBER OF HOMES HAVE BEEN BUILT, ALL WELL LANDSCAPED, AND LEAVING NO INDICATIONS OF THE FORMER FARM.  BECAUSE OF INTERVENING HOUSES, I MADE NO ATTEMPT TO MEASURE THE 170 YDS. NE OF STATION TO THE W. BROWN HOUSE (L.F.W. 1954 REPORT).  HOWEVER, THE E AND W AND ALSO THE N AND S STONE WALLS (IN W.D.P. 1934 REPORT) REMAIN STANDING IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, AND ARE MOST HELPFUL IN CHECKING DISTANCES TO STATION AND R.M.S.  A TOWER COULD BE ERECTED OVER INDIAN.  HEPBURN CHIMNEY JUTS S 1.115 FT. FROM FACE OF S FOUNDATION WALL OF HOUSE.  THEREFORE, STATION IS 4.765 FT.

DANEKER DOES NOT RECALL EVER HAVING SEEN THE DISK MARKING THE STATION, BUT HE TOLD ME THAT DISK MARKING THE REFERENCE POINT WAS SEEN ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO.  A SOUTH KINGSTOWN SURVEYOR ADVISES THAT HE TIED A SURVEY INTO THIS STATION A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO.  HE FURNISHED ME WITH ADDITIONAL REFERENCES.  A LARGE HOLE DUG WHERE HIS REFERENCES INTERSECTED FAILED TO BRING TO LIGHT THE BURIED MARKER.  THE BEACH GRASS WAS CUT OFF A LARGE AREA, BUT THE REFERENCE MARK WAS NOT FOUND.
