A LONGER DISTANCE OF 0.03 FOOT (0.01 M) OR 0.008 METER (0.026 FT) WAS NOTED TO REFERENCE MARK ONE.  A LONGER DISTANCE OF 0.04 FOOT (0.01 M) OR 0.012 METER (0.039 FT) WAS NOTED BETWEEN THE REFERENCE MARKS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE DIFFERENCES MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH THE DITCHES NEAR THE REFERENCE MARKS HAVE IN THEM DURING THE WINTER MONTHS.  IT MAY CAUSE THE MARKS TO SETTLE OR SLIP AROUND A SMALL AMOUNT.  THE STATION MARK IS NOT NEAR THE DITCH.                            STATION RECOVERY (2013)  RECOVERY NOTE BY DELAWARE COASTAL PROGRAM 2013 THE STATION WAS NOT RECOVERED.  RM 3 WAS RECOVERED AND THE MONUMENT IS LOOSE IN THE GROUND.

IT IS DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE INTERSECTION OF TRACK AND ROAD FROM MAGGIE S DELI AND SEVERAL OTHER BUSINESSES.  THE STATION BUILDING MENTIONED IN THE 1962 DESCRIPTION WAS NOT OBSERVED.  MEASUREMENTS IN THE DESCRIPTION WERE NOT CONFIRMED BUT APPEAR ACCURATE EXCEPT FOR THE DISTANCE OF 56 YARDS FROM THE STATION BUILDING. THIS ALMOST CERTAINLY SHOULD BE 56 FEET, BUT IN ANY EVENT THE STATION IS NO LONGER THERE.  THE CLOSEST POINT OF THE RAIL, AND THE PLACE APPARENTLY MEASURED TO, IS NEAR WHERE AN SIDE TRACK SWITCH WAS ONCE LOCATED. (SOME OF THE SIDE TRACK IS STILL IN PLACE.)  THE IRON FENCE MENTIONED IN THE 1981 RECOVERY REPORT WAS NOT OBSERVED, NOR WAS THE WOODEN WITNESS POST MENTIONED IN THE 1962 DESCRIPTION.  STATION DISK IS APPROXIMATELY 54.8 FEET WEST OF POWER POLE 58690 07154.

			"description": " BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1909 (ES) IT WAS FOUND THAT THE TUNNEL E CHIMNEY COULD NOT BE SEEN FROM THE HOTEL TOWER AND SO A POLE 77 FEET HIGH SW FROM THE OLD HOUSE WAS SET.  THIS POLE WAS SUPPORTED BY TWO SETS OF THREE IRON GUYS, THE TOP SET BEING 11 FEET FROM TOP OF POLE AND WAS THE POINT OBSERVED UPON.  WHEN OBSERVATIONS WERE COMPLETED THE STATION WAS MARKED WITH A COPPER TRIANGULATION-STATION MARK SET IN CEMENT 3 FEET BELOW SURFACE.  THIS POINT IS SOUTHEASTERLY FROM THE WELL AND WESTERLY FROM A WALNUT TREE.  REFERENCE MARK NO. 1 IS SQUARE CEMENT POST WITH BOTTLE TO MARK CENTER AT SE CORNER OF HOUSE.  REFERENCE MARK NO. 2 IS ROUND CEMENT POST WITH NAIL FOR CENTER AT NW CORNER OF THE HOUSE.  THIS PROPERTY IS OWNED BY DAVID DAISY AND OCCUPIED BY ROBERT COOPER.  IT IS BEST REACHED BY ROAD FROM OCEAN VIEW, DELAWARE.  THE FARM IS GENERALLY KNOWN AS THE HARRY TUNNEL PROPERTY.  IN NOVEMBER A 50-FOOT TRIPOD AND SCAFFOLD SIGNAL WAS BUILT IN ORDER TO SEE THE BETHEL CHURCH SPIRE AND THE HOTEL TOWER.  THE LEAVES WERE WELL OFF THE TREES AND HAD THEY NOT BEEN IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED AN 80-FOOT SIGNAL TO SEE THE BETHEL CHURCH OR THE CUTTING OF SEVERAL LARGE TREES ABOUT MIDWAY ON THE LINE.  WHILE THE SIGNAL WAS BEING BUILT, SEARCH WAS MADE FOR THE OLD STATION TUNNEL.  AN AREA OF 30 BY 50 FEET WAS DUG OVER AND NO MARKS WERE FOUND AND NO INDICATIONS THAT THE SUBSOIL HAD EVER BEEN DISTURBED.                            STATION RECOVERY (1934)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1934 (JCT) THE STATION MARK COULD NOT BE LOCATED BY THIS PARTY, DUE TO FAILURE TO RECOVER REFERENCE MARK NO. 1, BUT IT IS PROBABLY IN PLACE AND RECOVERABLE BY USE OF A PLANETABLE OR OTHER MEANS FOR RECOVERING THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE MARK.  A LARGE AREA WAS DUG OVER BUT THE MARK WAS NOT FOUND.  THE OLD TUNNEL HOUSE MENTIONED IN THE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION BURNED DOWN YEARS AGO, AND ANOTHER HOUSE HAS SINCE BEEN BUILT APPROXIMATELY ON THE SAME SITE.  REFERENCE MARK NO. 2 WAS RECOVERED IN GOOD CONDITION NEAR THE NW CORNER OF THE PRESENT HOUSE.  REFERENCE MARK NO. 1 WAS NOT RECOVERED, BUT IS BELIEVED TO BE UNDER THE HOUSE WHICH IS VERY LOW TO THE GROUND.  THE WALNUT TREE MENTIONED IN THE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION HAS BEEN DESTROYED.  THE HOUSE AT PRESENT IS UNOCCUPIED.                            STATION RECOVERY (1943)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1943 (FLG) STATION AND REFERENCE MARKS WERE RECOVERED AS DESCRIBED BY E.S. IN 1909 AND IN GOOD CONDITION.  REFERENCE MARK 1 IS NOW 18.030 M. (59.15 FT.) NE OF THE STATION.  REFERENCE MARK 2 IS NOW 11.651 M. (38.22 FT.) N OF THE STATION.                            STATION RECOVERY (1958)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1958 (JAW) STATION WAS RECOVERED AS DESCRIBED IN BOOK 377 PAGE 7.  THE STATION AND REFERENCE MARKS WERE FOUND IN GOOD CONDITION.  THE OLD MARK WAS FOUND ABOUT 2-1/2 FT.  UNDERGROUND, BRICKS FROM THE OLD CHIMNEY IN THE HOUSE WERE LAYED OVER THE TOP OF THE STATION SO THAT THE STATION COULD BE FOUND WITH A PRODDING BAR.  THE BRICKS SHOULD BE HIT ABOUT 1 FT. BELOW THE SURFACE.  BOTH REFERENCE MARKS WERE FOUND AS DESCRIBED EACH BEING 1 FT. FROM THE CORNERS OF THE OLD HOUSE AND ARE FLUSH OR JUST UNDER THE SOD.  BOTH THE NAIL AND THE TOP OF THE BOTTLE ARE EASY TO IDENTIFY.  A NEW MEASUREMENT OF 26.5 FT. SW OF THE SW CORNER OF THE OLD HOUSE MIGHT HELP TO LOCATE THE STATION MARK HOWEVER THE OLD HOUSE IS ABOUT TO FALL DOWN AND IT WONT BE THERE MUCH LONGER.  THE MEASUREMENTS TO THE RMS DESCRIBED CHECKED.  REACHED FROM THE JCT. OF ROUTES 14 AND 26 IN BETHANY BEACH AS FOLLOWS--GO W. ON 14 0.2 MILE TURN LEFT, S, AT THE BETHANY BEACH P O, GO 1.3 MILES TO WOODEN BRIDGE OVER THE ASSAWOMAN CANAL, CONTINUE OVER BRIDGE 0.1 MILE AND TURN LEFT, S, ON A SAND ROAD AND GO 0.75 MILE TO A TRIANGLE BLAZE ON TWIN PINE AT EDGE OF WOODS AT AN OLD WOODS ROAD.  WE LEFT TRUCK HERE AND WALKED ABOUT 1/2 MILE BACK TO THE OLD HOUSE AND STATION.  A TRUCK MIGHT BE DRIVEN TO THE STATION BY CLEARING THE OLD WOODS ROAD BUT A SMALL BRIDGE IS OUT AND IT WOULD BE A HARD CROSSING.  FOLLOW WOODS ROAD AND TURN LEFT AT A FORKS AND CONTINUE TO THE OLD HOUSE AND STATION.                            STATION RECOVERY (1961)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1961 (ETJ) STATION WAS RECOVERED AS DESCRIBED AND ALL MARKS FOUND IN GOOD CONDITION.

STATION RECOVERY (1961)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1961 (RMS) STATION MARK AND REFERENCE MARKS WERE RECOVERED IN GOOD CONDITION AS DESCRIBED BY J.A.W. IN 1958.  THE DISTANCES TO THE REFERENCE MARKS WERE VERIFIED.  REFERENCE MARK NO. 1 WAS LOCATED AT GROUND LEVEL AT THE S.E. CORNER OF THE HOUSE AND REFERENCE MARK NO. 2 WAS RECOVERED AT GROUND LEVEL AT THE N.W. CORNER OF THE HOUSE.  STATION IS 8.8 METERS SOUTHWEST FROM CENTER OF WELL ON SOUTH SIDE OF HOUSE.                            STATION RECOVERY (1962)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1962 (RWT) THE STATION, REFERENCE MARKS 1 AND 2 WERE RECOVERED AND FOUND TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION.
