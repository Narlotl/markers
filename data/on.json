THE MARKS WERE FOUND APPARENTLY AS ESTABLISHED.  REFERENCE MARK NO.1 WAS FOUND ALONG THE EAST FENCE ALONG THE CONCRETE ROAD TO THE NORTH OF THE STATION.  THE REFERENCE MARK ON THE TOP OF THE HILL WAS NOT FOUND BUT ONLY A FEW MINUTES WERE SPENT IN SEARCHING FOR IT.  THE ONE AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HAS BEEN REMOVED.  A STONE POST NOT MENTIONED IN THE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION WAS FOUND ON TOP OF THE HILL ABOUT 2 INCHES BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND.  IT WAS THE SAME SIZE AND OF THE SAME STONE AS THE MARK USED BY THE U.S. LAKE SURVEY.  THE HILL IS COMPOSED OF A VERY FINE SANDY SOIL SO IT IS EASY TO FIND AN UNDERGROUND MARK WITH A BAR.
