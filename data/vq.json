MARK IS A CADASTRAL SURVEY TRIANGULATION STATION DISK SET IN A DRILL HOLE NEAR THE CENTER OF THE TOP OF A CONCRETE CISTERN AND STAMPED T 41.  CISTERN PROJECTS ABOUT 4 FEET AND IS ABOUT 250 FEET EAST OF THE EASTERNMOST OF THE HOTEL BUILDINGS.  REFERENCE MARK NO. 1 IS A STANDARD I.A.G.S. REFERENCE MARK DISK SET IN A DRILL HOLE IN THE CENTER OF A CONCRETE STANCHION OF AN EAST WEST CONCRETE WALL AND STAMPED PETER R M NO 1 1953.  REFERENCE MARK NO. 2 IS A STANDARD I.A.G.S. REFERENCE MARK DISK SET IN A DRILL HOLE IN THE CENTER OF THE END, CORNERLIKE STANCHION OF THE CONCRETE WALL AND STAMPED PETER R M NO 2 1953.                            STATION RECOVERY (1955)  RECOVERY NOTE BY VIRGIN ISLANDS CADASTRAL SURVEY 1955 RECOVERED IN GOOD CONDITION.                            STATION RECOVERY (1965)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1965 (VES) THE STATION AND REFERENCE MARK 2 WERE RECOVERED IN GOOD CONDITION.  REFERENCE MARK 1 HAS BEEN COVERED BY THE CONSTRUCTION OF A BUILDING CURRENTLY IN USE AS A TELEVISION STATION.  A TV TOWER ABOUT 225 FT. HIGH HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED ON THE PILL BOX CONTAINING THE STATION.                            STATION RECOVERY (1993)  RECOVERY NOTE BY NATIONAL OCEAN SERVICE 1993 THE STATION IS LOCATED ON ST THOMAS ISLAND IN THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS IN THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE ISLAND ABOUT 1 MI (1.6 KM) LINEAR NORTHWEST OF CHARLOTTE AMALIE AT THE TOP OF A PROMINENT FORMATION KNOWN LOCALLY AS SIGNAL HILL AT THE EDGE OF MOUNTAINTOP ESTATES AT THE SITE OF A FORMER TELEVISION TRANSMITTER WHICH IS NOW GONE AND ADJACENT TO THE CELLULAR ONE ANTENNA.  REACHED FROM CHARLOTTE AMALIE BY PROCEEDING NORTH UP THE HILL ON ANY THROUGH ROAD, HIGHWAYS 35 AND 33 ARE THE PREFERRED ROUTE TO THE VICINITY OF THE MOUNTAINTOP AND THE ACCESS ROAD JUST BELOW THE CREST OF THE HILL.  A FOUR WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLE WILL BE REQUIRED TO NEGOTIATE THE FINAL 40 FT (12.2 M) OF THE CLIMB ON A LOOSE ROCK ROAD OR IT MUST BE PACKED.  ABOUT A 5 MINUTE PACK.  THE STATION IS BRONZE DISK WITH THE LOGO CADASTRAL SURVEY CAST INTO IT.  THE STAMPING IS DIM BUT READABLE.  IT IS SET IN THE CENTER OF A LARGE CONCRETE CISTERN IN THE TOP.  THE CISTERN HAS HAD LEGS OF TOWERS SET INTO IT AT VARIOUS TIMES BUT AT THE PRESENT HAS NONE IN USE.  THE REFERENCE MARKS AND TELEVISION TRANSMITTER BUILDING REFERRED TO IN THE 1955 DESCRIPTION ARE NO LONGER PRESENT.",
