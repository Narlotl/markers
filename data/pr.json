			"description": " BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1901 (JEM) THIS SIGNAL STATION IS ON ONE OF THE BLUFF PEAKS OVERLOOKING THE TOWN OF AGUADILLA, AND IS ON THE LAND OF JULIUS A. ROQUE, ONE OF THE ACCOUNTANTS IN THE LARGE BANKING AND COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT OF J. T. SILVA AND COMPANY.  THE STATION MARK IS A 2-INCH IRON PIPE SUNK IN THE ROCK FOR A DEPTH OF 13 INCHES AND THEN FIRMLY CEMENTED IN PLACE, OVER THIS THE POLE WAS SET.  A TRAIL WAS CLEARED OUT THROUGH THE THICK BRUSH SO AS TO INSURE EASY ACCESS.  IT LEADS FROM THE SWEET POTATO FIELD TO THE SUMMIT.  TO OCCUPY THE STATION INSTRUMENTS SHOULD BE TAKEN (IN VEHICLES) TO THE CABIN, IF ON PACK HORSE THEY CAN GO AS FAR AS THE SWEET POTATO FIELD, THEN THEY MUST BE CARRIED BY PORTERS.  THE STATION CAN BE APPROACHED FROM TWO DIRECTIONS AND THE ROUTES OF ACCESS ARE AS FOLLOWS--FOLLOW THE SAN JUAN ROAD, EASTWARD FROM AGUADILLA UP THE STEEP SLOPE BY WHICH IT LEAVES THE TOWN TO THE FIRST LEVEL STRETCH ON THE HIGH LEVEL ALMOST TO A PASS WHICH CARRIES THE ROAD BETWEEN A BUTTE ON YOUR RIGHT (THE N) AND THE ENCIRCLING RIM OF HILLS WHICH SURROUND AGUADILLA.  A VERY NOTABLE MARK WHICH WILL IDENTIFY THIS PASS IS THE LARGE WATER BASIN PARTLY NATURAL AND PARTLY ARTIFICIAL WHICH WILL BE NOTED JUST S OF THE ROAD IN THE BASE OF THE NW CORNER OF THE HILL IN THE S SIDE OF THE ROAD.  MR. ROQUES FARM IS ON THE W SIDE OF THE RANGE, S OF THE ROAD AND HE HAS UTILIZED ONE OF THE LARGE CAVE LIKE HOLES OF THE HILL TO MAKE A GREAT BASIN, WHOSE SIDES ARE CEMENTED UP WITH WALLS WHERE BREAKS FORMERLY EXISTED.  STANDING AT THE GATE WHICH LEADS INTO A SHED USED FOR STOCK AND GIVES ACCESS TO A WRETCHED LOOKING HOUSE, WHICH SEEMS TO BE USED BY MR. ROQUES CARETAKER, JUST W OF THE GREAT BASIN AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE RIM OF HILLS, ONE WILL NOTE FOUR SEPARATE ONES S OF THE MAIN ROAD.  THE MAIN ROAD WINDS AROUND THE BASE OF THE FIRST ONE, WHICH HAS A LONG BROAD TOP.  THE SECOND HILL SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF BARE ROCK NEAR ITS SUMMIT AND S SIDE.  THE THIRD HILL IS SUGAR LOAF IN SHAPE AND HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF MASSIGO TREES ON IT, (THE MASSIGO IS THE REDDISH BARKED PUERTO RICAN TREE WHICH IS SO BRITTLE AND UNSAFE TO CLIMB), THE FOURTH SEEMS TO HAVE AN OVER-HANGING TOP AND THE FACE (TOWARDS THE SEA) OF THE UPPER HALF IS VERY BARE AND PRECIPITOUS.  IT WAS ON THE FOURTH HILL THAT AGUADILLA WAS LOCATED.  THE FOURTH HILL CUTS OFF ALL VIEW OF THE OTHER HILLS (S) FROM A MAN STANDING AT SENOR ROQUES GATE.  TO REACH THE SIGNAL ONE SHOULD ENTER SENOR ROQUES N GATE AND FOLLOW HIS FARM ROAD TO HIS S GATE, AND THEN GO INTO THE BASE OF THE HILL, BUT IT IS AN EXTREMELY ROUGH TRAIL TO THE BASE AND A VERY MEAN CLIMB UP THE FACE OF THE BLUFF AND PARTICULARLY BAD FOR AN INSTRUMENT.  A MAN HAS TO DRAG HIMSELF UP BY HIS ARMS IN PLACES.  THE SECOND AND PREFERABLE ROUTE IS FOR THE MAN TO CONTINUE ON THE SAN JUAN MAIN ROAD EASTWARD THROUGH THE PASS WHERE A BRANCH ROAD JOINS THE MAIN ROAD, COMING FROM THE N COAST.  THIS BRANCH ROAD PASSES ON S SIDE OF THE MILITARY RIFLE RANGE AND CAMP OF INSTRUCTION.  AT THE JUNCTION POINT JUST REFERRED TO, ARE TWO SMALL BUILDINGS.  ON THE N SIDE IS A SMALL BOOTH WHICH IS USED AS A BUTCHER SHOP, ACROSS THE ROAD IS A LARGE CABIN.  THE CABIN HAS A DOOR AND WINDOW ON THE SIDE FRONTING THE ROAD AND THE FLOOR IS SOME LITTLE DISTANCE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE ROAD, ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE CAN BE HAD BY MEANS OF A LITTLE TWO-STEP LADDER.  ON THE E SIDE OF THE HOUSE THE WALL IS COVERED WITH CLAPBOARDS.  E OF THE HOUSE IS A SMALL PATCH OF BEANS.  LEAVE THE ROAD AT THE CABIN THROUGH THE GATE ON ITS E SIDE AND FOLLOW TRAIL, WHICH LIES BETWEEN THE BEAN FIELD AND THE FOOT OF THE HILL (AT WHOSE BASE THE CABIN IS BUILT), EASTWARD, KEEPING ON UNTIL YOU ENTER AN OLD FIELD BENDING GENERALLY TOWARDS YOUR RIGHT.  THIS COURSE WILL BRING YOU AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE FIELD TO A PLACE WHERE THE ROAD NARROWS, A GROWTH OF BUSHES ON YOUR LEFT AND SMALL BUTTE ON YOUR RIGHT, NARROWING IT MATERIALLY.  THE BUTTE JUST REFERRED TO, IS DISTINCT FROM THE FIRST HILL. THE NARROW SECTION LASTS FOR ABOUT 150 FEET AND THEN YOU ENTER ANOTHER OLD FIELD.  JUST AS YOU REACH THE END OF THE NARROW SECTION, AS YOU LOOK AHEAD, YOU WILL NOTE WHAT SEEMS TO BE A NARROW DEEP PASS THROUGH THE HILLS, WHICH APPARENTLY LEADS THROUGH TO THE SEA.  ON THE RIGHT (N) SIDE OF THIS PASS IS A ROUND TOPPED HILL AND ON THIS HILL IS AGUADILLA.  AS YOU STAND IN THE PASS THE LEFT HALF OF AGUADILLA HILL SEEMS THICKLY COVERED WITH TALL BARE-LIMBED TREES OF A REDDISH BROWN COLOR (MASSIGO TREES).  THEY SEEM TO RUN FROM THE GAP (LEADING THROUGH TO THE SEA) ALMOST TO THE TOP OF THE HILL, BUT THEY DO NOT QUITE REACH THE TOP.  FROM WHERE THE TRAIL STRIKES THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND OLD FIELD THE TOP OF AGUADILLA HILL BEARS MAGNETIC 249 DEG.  AT THE END OF A SECOND OLD FIELD IS A FENCE AND BEYOND THAT A LARGE PATCH OF SWEET POTATOES IS GROWING.  THE SWEET POTATO FIELD EXTENDS TO THE BASE OF AGUADILLA HILL.  THE TOP OF AGUADILLA HILL IS VERY SMALL, JUST ABOUT LARGE ENOUGH FOR THE SIGNAL STATION, AND ALL THE GROWTH WAS CHOPPED AND CLEARED AWAY.",

THE MOUNTAIN SEEMS TO HAVE A FAIRLY LEVEL TOP (BUT IT HASNT) FROM THE RAILROAD STATION AND THE POINT ON WHICH THE SIGNAL IS SEEMS TO BE THE HIGHEST PEAK.  IT IS ENTIRELY CLEAR OF TREES, BUT ABOUT 25 FEET BELOW THE TOP IS A LITTLE GROUP OF MANGOES.  THESE SHOW AS ONE TREE A LITTLE WAY BELOW THE TOP AND ON THE LEFT RIDGE COMING FROM THE SUMMIT.  THE STATION MARK IS A 2-INCH IRON PIPE, BURIED IN THE GROUND FOR ABOUT 17 INCHES AND LEAVING ABOUT 2-1/2 INCHES EXPOSED.  IT WAS EMBEDDED IN CEMENT AND THE CENTER OF THE PIPE WAS FILLED WITH THE SAME MATERIAL.  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PIPE WAS SET AN IRON NAIL AND THE CENTER OF THE HEAD OF THIS NAIL MARKS THE STATION.  ABOUT 25 FEET (VERTICALLY) BELOW THE SIGNAL AND ABOUT SW FROM IT, IS A ROW OF MANGO TREES, YOUNG AND THRIVING.  THE SPANIARDS HAD A SIGNAL ABOUT 9 OR 10 FEET E OF THIS ONE, BUT LEFT NO STATION MARK AND WE ONLY KNOW OF ITS FORMER EXISTENCE HERE FROM THE REPORT HEARD FROM THE NATIVES.  TO REACH THE SUMMIT, TWO WAYS CAN BE UTILIZED.  ONE IS TO FOLLOW THE TRACK WESTWARD FROM TRES HERMANOS AND CROSSING TWO BRIDGES, GO ON FOR A FEW HUNDRED METERS WHERE INQUIRIES SHOULD BE MADE FOR A ROAD THAT GOES UP THE BED OF A CREEK AT THE BEGINNING AND LEADING OUT OF THIS WILL BE FOUND A FAIR BUT VERY STEEP ROAD, WHICH CAN BE FOLLOWED TO THE SUMMIT AND THE STATION.  ON A VERY SURE FOOTED HORSE OR MULE, ONE CAN RIDE MOST OF THE WAY UP.  THE SECOND AND BETTER WAY OF REACHING THE SIGNAL IS TO GO TO CORSICA (OR CORCHEGA) STATION FOR A STARTING POINT.  AT CORSICA, ATALAYA SHOWS IN THE E AS THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN IN VIEW.  A GUIDE CAN BE SECURED HERE WHO WILL TAKE ONE UP.  IF HE DOES NOT KNOW THE STATION BY NAME, OR AS THE BANDERA CERRO HE WILL KNOW WHERE TO TAKE ONE WHEN ASKED TO LEAD TO MIGUEL CARREROS HOME.  MIGUEL CARRERO IS THE OWNER OF THE HILLTOP AND HIS HOME IS AT THE HEAD OF A LITTLE GULCH JUST E OF THE SIGNAL AND ABOUT 75 FEET (VERTICALLY) BELOW IT.  A TRAIL LEADS RIGHT OVER THE SUMMIT OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THE SIGNAL HAVING BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE CENTER OF THE PATH.  SENOR CARRERO DEFLECTED THE PATH, CUT OUT A NEW LOCATION AND PLACED A FENCE OF WILD PINEAPPLE BUSHES BETWEEN THE SIGNAL AND THE NEW TRAIL.  THE TOP OF THE PEAK IS VERY LIMITED IN EXTENT AND THE SIGNAL IS ON THE VERY HIGHEST PART OF IT AND ABOUT IN ITS CENTER.                            STATION RECOVERY (1901)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1901 (JEM) THE SURFACE MARK WAS FOUND APPARENTLY UNDISTURBED IN JANUARY 1901, BUT A STORM OF LAST OCTOBER LEFT ONLY ABOUT 20 INCHES OF THE JAGGED END OF THE POLE ABOVE THE TRIPOD BOLT, AND THE S LEG WAS BROKEN (AT A SPLICE) BY THE SAME STORM.  THIS WAS AFTERWARDS REPLACED AND A NEW POLE WAS SET IN PLACE ON THE SIGNAL.

MOST OF THIS DISTANCE IS OVER A ROUGH TRAIL.  THE POINT IS WELL-KNOWN BY BEING THE ONLY BARE ONE IN THE VICINITY.  THE CENTER IS MARKED BY A TACK DRIVEN INTO A STUB ABOUT 2 FEET LONG, WHICH PROJECTS ABOUT 2 INCHES ABOVE THE SURFACE.  A TRIPOD SIGNAL ABOUT 25 FEET HIGH WAS BUILT OVER THIS STATION.                            STATION RECOVERY (1934)  RECOVERY NOTE BY US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 1934 FOUND IN GOOD CONDITION, APPARENTLY UNDISTURBED.  THE SUMMIT HAS 3 MAIN PEAKS, ONE IS ABOUT 150 METERS TO THE NE OF THE STATION AND ABOUT 15 FEET HIGHER IN ELEVATION, ANOTHER IS ABOUT 200 METERS TO THE NW OF STATION, AND ABOUT THE SAME ELEVATION.  STATION MAY BE REACHED FROM EITHER COAMO OR SALINAS.  CAR CAN BE TAKEN NEARER TO THE FOOT OF PEAK FROM SALINAS, BUT THE CLIMB TO TOP FROM THAT SIDE IS MUCH STEEPER.  TO REACH FROM SALINAS, FOLLOW CARRETERA LEADING TO CAYEY TO KILOMETER POST K5-H3, AT HOUSE AND SMALL TIENDA TURN NORTHWESTWARD THROUGH GATE AND FOLLOW A SECOND CLASS ROAD 3.7 KILOMETERS TO LARGE, RED-ROOFED, FRAME HOUSE, THEN FOLLOW A DIM ROAD WHICH TURNS TO THE LEFT ACROSS STREAM, KEEPING TO RIGHT AT FORKS, 0.9 KILOMETER FROM LARGE HOUSE, AND LATER PASSING THROUGH A DOUBLE CORRAL. AT PRESENT TIME CAR CAN BE TAKEN TO BANK OF STREAM 2.3 KILOMETERS FROM THE LARGE FRAME HOUSE.  FROM THIS POINT A TRAIL IS FOLLOWED, CLIMBING THE MIDDLE RIDGE BETWEEN MAIN DRAIN FORKS.  IF ENTERING FROM COAMO, FOLLOW MAIN HIGHWAY, LEADING TO AIBONITO FOR ABOUT 4 KILOMETERS TO SECOND CLASS ROAD BRANCHING OFF TO RIGHT AT KILOMETER POST K93-H8, KEEP TO LEFT ACROSS DRAIN AT FIRST FORKS AND CONTINUE AS FAR AS CAR CAN BE TAKEN, AT WHICH POINT INQUIRE AS TO ROUTE AS THERE IS NO MAIN TRAIL GOING DIRECTLY TO THE STATION.  STATION IS NOW MARKED BY A 2-INCH GALVANIZED-IRON PIPE PROJECTING 3 INCHES ABOVE SURFACE OF GROUND.  REFERENCE MARK NO.1 IS A COPPER NAIL AND WASHER IN A BLAZE ON A DOUBLE-TRUNKED CORCHO TREE, ABOUT 6 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, 93.45 FEET (INCLINED DISTANCE) FROM STATION IN TRUE AZIMUTH 355 DEG 16 MIN.

BOTH REFERENCE MARKS WERE SEARCHED FOR BUT NOT FOUND.  THE U.S. COAST GUARD LIGHT HAS BEEN MOVED TO THE PREVIOUSLY ABANDONED LIGHTHOUSE ABOUT 0.3 MILES FURTHER INSHORE.  THE LIGHT STRUCTURE AT FIGG WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPORTED BY 4 CONCRETE PILES AND A SQUARE CONCRETE FOOTING WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN POURED IN PLACE ON THE SURFACE.  A COAST GUARDSMAN REPORTED THAT IN 1966 SAND ON THE POINT WAS LEVEL WITH THE TOP OF THE FOOTING, BUT SINCE THEN THE LEVEL HAS FLUCTUATED.  IN 1970 NATIONAL OCEAN SURVEY SHORELINE PHOTOGRAPHS, THE SAND LEVEL WAS VERY LOW AND MHWL WAS INSHORE OF THE TOWER.  NOW, THE SAND IS ALMOST A FOOT ABOVE MHWL BUT STILL ONE FOOT BELOW THE FOOTING.

IT IS ABOUT 300 METERS N 43 DEG E FROM THE HIGHEST KNOB ON THIS RANGE OF HILLS.  THIS RANGE IS CALLED THE SANTA ROSA BEING ON THE PLANTATION OF THE SAME NAME.  THIS POINT IS ABOUT 1-1/2 MILES DISTANT AND BEARS S 71 DEG W FROM THE TOWN OF QUEBRADILLAS.  IT IS ABOUT 1-3/4 MILES ON THE WINDING ROAD ALONG THE RIO GUAJATOCA, AFTER CROSSING THE BRIDGE ON THE MAIN ROAD TOWARDS ISABELA.  AFTER LEAVING THE TEAM, THE APPROACH TO THIS STATION IS UP A VERY STEEP RAVINE WHICH IS FILLED WITH LARGE BOULDERS AND A GROWTH OF BANANA TREES.  THE MARK IS THE CENTER OF A GALVANIZED PIPE 2 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND 2 FEET LONG, WHICH WAS SET IN A BED OF CEMENT.  THE TOP OF THE PIPE PROJECTS ABOUT 4 INCHES ABOVE THE BED OF CEMENT.                            STATION RECOVERY (1922)  RECOVERY NOTE BY US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 1922 THE MARK HAS BEEN DESTROYED, BUT A HOLE WAS FOUND IN THE EARTH AND ROCK FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN REMOVED.  PIECES OF CEMENT WITH THE IMPRINT OF AN IRON PIPE WERE ALSO FOUND IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE HOLE.  A LARGE LIMESTONE ROCK WAS PLANTED IN THE HOLE AND THE NEW STATION MARK CEMENTED INTO IT.  IT IS PROBABLY NOT MORE THAN 0.1 METER AWAY FROM THE OLD POSITION.  THE STATION IS MARKED BY A STANDARD U.S.G.S. BRONZE BENCH MARK TABLET CEMENTED IN A DRILL HOLE IN LIMESTONE ROCK AND PROJECTS 5 OR 6 CENTIMETERS ABOVE THE GROUND.  REFERENCE MARK NO.1, IS A DRILL HOLE IN SOLID ROCK ON THE N SLOPE OF THE HILL, 4.94 METERS DISTANT ON A TRUE AZIMUTH OF 125 DEG 20 MIN 00 SEC.  REFERENCE MARK NO.2, IS A DRILL HOLE IN SOLID ROCK ON THE W SLOPE OF THE HILL, 7.85 METERS DISTANT ON A TRUE AZIMUTH OF 263 DEG 20 MIN 56 SEC.  THE STATION IS BEST REACHED FROM THE CARRETERA ON THE S BY TAKING A SECOND CLASS ROAD WHICH LEAVES THE MAIN ROAD AT A RAILROAD CROSSING ON THE W BANK OF THE GUAJATACA RIVER, AND FOLLOWING THIS UP STREAM ABOUT 3 KILOMETERS.  ABOUT 300 METERS BEYOND THE POINT WHERE THE RIVER AND ROAD MAKE A SHARP BEND TO THE E IS A SMALL FLAT, LYING BETWEEN THE BLUFF AND THE RIVER, FROM MIDWAY OF WHICH A DIM TRAIL LEADS DIRECTLY UP THE BLUFF, THE STATION IS TO THE LEFT OR E OF THIS TRAIL ON THE RIDGE OVERLOOKING THE GUAJATACA RIVER.

STATION RECOVERY (1934)  RECOVERY NOTE BY US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 1934 FOUND AS DESCRIBED IN NOTES OF 1922, IT IS IN GOOD CONDITION, APPARENTLY UNDISTURBED.  THE TOP OF MOUNTAIN HAD GROWN UP WITH THICK BRUSH, WHICH WAS CUT AWAY, LEAVING A LONE CLUMP FOR THE SIGNAL.  THE TRAIL ROUTE TO THE STATION, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTES OF 1922, HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED, AND IS GROWN UP WITH BRUSH, AND AS THE RIVER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN IS VERY STEEP AND COVERED WITH THICK BRUSH, THE BEST ROUTE TO STATION AT PRESENT (1934), IS TO LEAVE CAR AT HOUSE ALONG ROAD, ON THE RIVER BEND MENTIONED IN NOTES OF 1922, AND FOLLOW A DIM TRAIL UP THE SLOPE AND AROUND W SIDE OF RIDGE TO THE FIRST DRAW COMING IN FROM THE LEFT (E), THEN FOLLOW UP THIS DRAW ABOUT 0.25 MILE TO FIRST MAIN DRAW COMING IN FROM THE LEFT (ABOUT 300 FEET AFTER PASSING OVER A DIFFICULT ROCK LEDGE), FOLLOW UP THIS SECOND DRAW ABOUT 200 FEET TO WHERE IT DIVIDES, THEN CROSS OVER LOW RIDGE TO THE LEFT (W) INTO ANOTHER DRAW.  TURN RIGHT UP THIS DRAW AND CONTINUE TO POINT WHERE IT FLATTENS OUT IN A GRASSY OPENING.  AT PRESENT THERE IS A SMALL THATCHED SHED HERE BUT PROBABLY WILL NOT REMAIN LONG.  THE STATION IS ON THE RIDGE JUST ABOVE AND TO THE W, THICK BRUSH COVERS THE SLOPE.  A TRAIL WAS CLEARED TO THE TOP BUT WILL NOT REMAIN CLEARED FOR LONG.",

			"description": " BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1901 (JEM) THIS STATION IS ON A HIGH HILL WHICH WAS FORMERLY CALLED CEM DE BAHAN, FROM THE NAME OF ITS FORMER OWNER A SENOR DE BAZUN, BUT HE SOLD THE PROPERTY TO A JULIANO LEBRON AND THE LATTERS SON INSISTED THAT THE HILL WAS NOW RENO DE LEBRON.  THE NAME GIVEN IS IMMATERIAL, NEITHER ONE WOULD, IN ANY PROBABILITY, BE RECOGNIZED A MILE AWAY FROM THE STATION.  IN PUERTO RICO THE NATIVES DO NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THE NAMES OF STREAMS OR HILLS, AND MOST OF THE TIME NATIVE COURTESY IMPELS THEM TO GIVE US A NAME ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT BECAUSE THEY FIND THAT WE THINK ONE SHOULD BE KNOWN, NOT THAT THE PLACE HAD ONE BEFORE.  FOR A STATION MARK WE DUG AND DRILLED A HOLE IN THE ROCKY TOP FOR A PIECE OF 2-INCH IRON PIPE WHICH IS SUNK TO WITHIN ABOUT 1-1/2 INCHES FROM ITS TOP (13-1/2 INCHES ARE UNDERGROUND) AND CEMENTED INTO PLACE.  IN PREPARING THE STATION CENTER THE HOLE DUG OUT WAS PRETTY LARGE BUT THE PIPE WAS SET IN THE CORNER NEAREST TO MALA PASCUA.  THE SIDE OF THE TUBE BEING PRESSED UP TO THE S EDGE OF THE HOLE AND THE OTHER SIDES BEING SECURED, FIRST WITH WELL-RAMMED STONE, AND THEN BY CEMENT.  THREE TREES WERE BLAZED FOR WITNESS MARKS AND THE DISTANCES MEASURED TO THEM.  ONE IS A DAJO TREE ABOUT NNW.  THIS TREE DIVIDES INTO TWO PARTS ABOUT 3 FEET ABOVE ITS ROOTS.  THE E SECTION IS ABOUT 4 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND THE BLAZE ON ITS FACE IS 13.18 FEET FROM THE STATION CENTER.  THE SECOND BLAZE WAS MADE ON PALO DE VACA STUMP WHICH GREW IN SOUTHWARD FROM STATION.  IT IS 5 FEET TO THE E OF A LINE FROM THE STATION TO POINT VIENTO 2.  THIS PALO DE VACA IS ABOUT 10 INCHES IN DIAMETER, HAS A LIGHT-COLORED TRUNK AND THE TOP WAS CUT OFF BY US WHEN CLEARING THE HILLTOP.  THE STUMP IS ABOUT 4 FEET HIGH AND THE BLAZE IS 13.36 FEET FROM THE STATION MARK.  THE THIRD BLAZE IS ON A GOOJEO TREE E OF THE SIGNAL.  THIS TREE IS ABOUT 10 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND HAS LOST ITS TOP.  THE LENGTH OF THE TRUNK OF THE TREE IS ABOUT 20 FEET.  THE BLAZE IS 20.81 FEET FROM STATION CENTER.  THE DAJO TREE REFERRED TO ABOVE WAS CUT DOWN TO WITHIN 3 FEET OF THE GROUND.  THIS WAS DONE BECAUSE IT MADE A BAD BACKGROUND FOR LEBRON WHEN OBSERVED FROM MALA PASCUA.  TO REACH LEBRON ONE SHOULD FOLLOW THE ROAD BETWEEN MAUNABO AND GUAYAMA TO THE PLANTATION HOUSE OF DON BERNALDO MERLE (PRONOUNCED MU LA) A GENTLEMAN OF FRENCH EXTRACTION WHO SPEAKS ENGLISH QUITE WELL.  LOOKING INLAND FROM DON MERLES PORCH, LEBRON HILL IS A HIGH WOODED SUMMIT WHICH TOWERS ABOVE THE VALLEY TO THE NORTHWARD, HAVING A CLEARED SPACE OF SEVERAL ACRES ON ITS SOUTH SLOPE A SHORT DISTANCE BELOW THE TOP.  SENOR MERLE CAN POINT OUT THE HILL AS I SHOWED HIM THE SIGNAL FROM HIS FRONT DOOR. TO REACH IT ONE SHOULD FOLLOW THE ROUGH CART ROAD WHICH RUNS INLAND FROM THE MERLE PLANTATION (THE ROAD IS ONLY SUITABLE FOR OXCARTS, SADDLE HORSES AND PEDESTRIANS) TO THE HOUSE OF JULIANO LEBRON.  THE WALK FROM MERLES TO LEBRONS WILL TAKE ABOUT 25 MINUTES AT A MODERATE PACE.  THE SETTLEMENT NEAR THE SCHOOLHOUSE ON THIS ROAD IS CALLED JACOBY (OR JACABOA).  IN GOING TO SENOR LEBRONS A MOUNTAIN STREAM MUST BE CROSSED AT THREE DIFFERENT PLACES.  THIS CAN BE DONE ON STEPPING STONES, DRY SHOD, UNLESS THE STREAM IS SWOLLEN BY HEAVY RAINS.  AT LEBRONS EITHER OF HIS TWO SONS (MARCIAL OR VINCENTE) CAN BE HAD, WHO WILL TAKE ANYONE TO THE SIGNAL. A TRAIL STARTS FROM LEBRONS HOUSE, WHICH GOES TO THE SUMMIT, BUT IT IS EXTREMELY STEEP AND AFTER THE SECOND SUMMIT IS REACHED, A HORSE CANNOT BE USED ON IT, AS IT LEADS THROUGH DENSE BRUSH, OVER FALLEN AND MATTED TREES, AND UP PRECIPITOUS ASCENTS WHICH ARE ONLY TO BE PASSED BY MEN ON FOOT.  THE TOP OF THE HILL WAS DENSELY COVERED WITH TREES AND BUSHES.  MANY OF THESE SAN CYNACO HAD BEEN CLEANED OUT AND WE CHOPPED OUT A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT WAS LEFT.  THE TOP HAS A THIN COVERING OF SOIL BUT IS IN GENERAL PRETTY ROCKY.  AT THE STATION ONE CAN SEE THE S END OF MAUNABO VILLAGE, POINT TUNA LIGHTHOUSE, POINT VIENTO, FIGURAS LIGHTHOUSE, ARROYO, CORAZON, AND CAJO DE MUERTAS.  THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE SUMMIT OF THE RIDGE IS N-S.  THE SIGNAL WAS AN 18-FOOT PITCH PINE POLE BRACED BY 4 STRUTS WHICH WERE ALSO CONNECTED WITH THE CENTER POLE BY CROSS PIECES NEAR THEIR FOOT.",

			"description": " BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1900 (JN) IT HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO DECIDE UPON WHAT IS THE TRUE NAME OF THIS HILL BECAUSE OF THE ABUNDANCE OF CHOICE OF NAMES OFFERED.  OUR FIRST INFORMANT, ABAD PARTILLO, AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT NATIVE OF GUANICA, TOLD US THAT THE HILL ON WHICH THE STATION WAS PLACED WAS CALLED MOZAMBIQUE (THE SPANISH NAME FOR THE SMALL BLACK BIRD LIKE THE COW BIRD OF THE SW UNITED STATES) WHICH IS VERY COMMON ON THE ISLAND AND WE BEGAN TO USE THAT NAME IN THE RECORD.  AFTER OUR ARRIVAL IN PARGUERA WE WERE TOLD THERE THAT MOZAMBIQUE WAS A SMALLER MOUNTAIN BEYOND THIS AND THAT THE NAME OF THE HILL WAS MARIQUITA.  AS OUR INFORMANTS LIVED MUCH NEARER THE HILL THAN PARTILLO, WE CONCLUDED HE WAS MISTAKEN AND CALLED THE STATION MARIQUITA, CHANGING THE NAME IN THE RECORD WHERE THE OTHER NAME HAD BEEN WRITTEN.  A FEW OBSERVATIONS HAD BEEN MADE ON IT THEN. WHEN WE REACHED BOQUERON WE COULD FIND NO ONE WHO KNEW OF ANY SUCH NAME AS MARIQUITA FOR THE MOUNTAIN, AND THE ONLY NAME KNOWN THERE WAS MOZAMBIQUE.  HEARING THAT A SURVEYOR LIVED IN THE VILLAGE, WE VISITED HIM TO GET HIS VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT.  HE ACCOMPANIED US OUT TO WHERE A GOOD VIEW OF THE STATION COULD BE HAD, AND ON THE SIGNAL BEING POINTED OUT, AND HE BEING ASKED THE NAME, SAID HAL SIERRA BERMEJAI.  ON FURTHER EXAMINATION HE SAID THAT HE KNEW THERE WAS A HILL IN THE RANGE CALLED MOZAMBIQUE BUT WHICH ONE IT WAS HE DID NOT KNOW, BUT HE WAS POSITIVE THAT THE RANGE WAS CALLED SIERRA BERMEJA (RED RANGE).  THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE RED PORPHYRY ON THE HILL AND THE EXPOSED ROCKS HAVE A GENERAL NOTICEABLE REDDISH TINT.  IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS IS CALLED THE RED RANGE AND THAT OUR SIGNAL IS ON MOZAMBIQUE HILL.  THE HILL IS A VERY NOTICEABLE ONE.  IT IS THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE CHAIN WHICH EXTENDS ALONG THE COAST FROM BREA TO THE W COAST OF THE ISLAND, BOUNDING ON THE S THE PRETTY VALLEY WHICH EXTENDS FROM LAKE GUANICA TO BOQUERON.  THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT WHAT HILL THE STATION IS ON TO ANYONE COMING TO THE SW COAST OF THE ISLAND, AS IT IS ON THE HIGHEST POINT OF A RIDGE WHERE LOCATION IS UNQUESTIONABLE FROM ITS RELATION TO THE VALLEY JUST MENTIONED.  MARK IS A 2-FOOT PIECE OF 2-INCH IRON PIPE OF WHICH ABOUT 17 INCHES IS BURIED IN GROUND AND SECURED BY CEMENT.  CENTER OF PIPE IS FILLED WITH CEMENT AND AT THE N POINT OF PIPE, A NAIL HAS BEEN SET WHOSE N EDGE IS THE CENTER OF STATION.  PIPE WAS SET BEFORE STATION WAS PLUMBED DOWN CAREFULLY AND SO THE NAIL IS OFF TO ONE SIDE.  ABOUT 4 METERS W OF STATION MARK AND ABOUT 16 METERS N OF IT, THE GROUND BEGINS TO SLOPE OFF FROM TOP.  OWNER OF LAND IS ANTONIO GARATASIO.  PELEGRIN TORRES OF BOQUERON AND JOSE BAIS OF PARGUERA HAVE ACCOMPANIED THE PARTY TO THIS STATION AND CAN POINT IT OUT.  TO REACH STATION FROM BOQUERON, TAKE ROAD WHICH LEADS TO DR. HERNANDEZS SUGAR HOUSE AND THEN GO S TO BASE OF HILLS THAT WILL BE IN VIEW (THESE ARE THE BERMEJA RANGE).  WHEN THE ROAD AT THE BASE OF THE HILLS IS REACHED, TURN E AND DRIVE ON TO CABIN OF DELORES GARCIA.  HERE THE VEHICLE MUST BE LEFT AND ONE MUST GO ALONG THE TRAIL LEADING UP THE VALLEY DOWN WHICH A CLEAR STREAM OF WATER FLOWS.  A SHORT DISTANCE BEYOND A SPRING THAT WILL BE MET A TRAIL WILL BE NOTICED TURNING TO RIGHT AND GOING UP HILLSIDE.  THIS LEADS TO SUMMIT OF HILL AND STATION.  FOR CONVENIENCE OF OBSERVATION, EXTENSIVE CLEARING OF TREES AND BRUSH HAS BEEN MADE ABOUT SUMMIT.  CLEARING WILL BE GOOD MARK.  TOP OF HILL IS FLAT.  NEAR THE NW EDGE OF THIS FLAT, STATION WAS LOCATED.                            STATION RECOVERY (1901)  RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1901 (JEM) STATION RECOVERED.  THE HILL ON WHICH IT IS LOCATED IS A VERY HIGH ONE, ABOUT 970 FEET BY BAROMETER AND IS LOCATED ON THE PROPERTY ON DON PEPI CARTAGENA, AN AGED AND WEALTHY LAND OWNER AND LAWYER, WHOSE HOME IS IN SAN GERMAN.  THE HACIENDA IS CALLED DESENGANO.  THE PEOPLE ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE (ON THE ESTATE) AND AS FAR AS LAJAS AND SAN GERMAN CALLED THE MOUNTAIN FENAJA, THE SPANISH NAME FOR THE POROUS EARTH BOTTLES IN WHICH DRINKING WATER IS COOLED.  THE HILL IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CLIMB THE WAY WE WENT UP, THE SLOPE BEING STEEP, COVERED WITH LOOSE STONES, AND THE PATH GOING THROUGH A DENSE THORNY GROWTH OF BUSHES, BUT A PATH WAS SHOWN ME ON WHICH I CAME DOWN WHICH MAKES THE ASCENT VERY EASY.  ANYONE VISITING THE STATION HAD BETTER GET A GUIDE ON THE CARTAGENA PLANTATION, AND USE THIS PATH.",

THIS IS ON THE HIGHEST SUMMIT BETWEEN THE FANDURA MOUNTAIN AND THE CONICAL-TOPPED HILL (VERY NOTICEABLE) WHICH I CALLED RASPE PELA AT SANTA HELENA AND THIS STATION.  THE MEN WITH ME SAY THAT WHAT I HAVE CALLED RASPE PELA SHOULD BE CALLED MATUYA, AND SAY THAT WHAT I CALLED F IS RASPE PELA. LATER ON I LEARNED THAT MATUYA IS THE NAME OF THE BARRIO IN WHICH THE CONICAL PEAK IS SITUATED.  THIS IS BUT ANOTHER INSTANCE OF THE GENERAL EXPERIENCE WE HAVE THAT NO TWO LOTS OF NATIVES AGREE ON A NAME FOR ALMOST ANY PEAK.  THE TOP OF MORALES IS COVERED WITH GRASS, ON THE NW IS A THICK GROWTH OF VINES, AND ON THE HILL ARE A NUMBER OF LARGE MASSES OF GRANITE. ON THE SW SLOPE MORALES HAS A PLANTATION OF BANANAS AND SWEET POTATOES WHICH COMES ALMOST TO THE SUMMIT OF THE HILL.  JUST N OF THE SIGNAL THE HILL SLOPES STEEPLY DOWN INTO A PASS WHICH IS MUCH WIDER THAN THE PANDURA PASS.  THIS PASS IS BETWEEN MORALES AND HILLS WHICH SLOPE UP TO THE CONICAL (OR SUGAR LOAF HILL) RASPE PELA.  ABOUT 2 FEET E OF THE STATION MARK IS THE LARGEST STUMP ON THE HILLTOP.  STATION MARK IS A PIECE OF IRON PIPE, ALMOST 12 INCHES LONG AND 2 INCHES IN DIAMETER.  THIS IS CEMENTED IN THE GROUND AND FILLED WITH CEMENT.  A NAIL IN THE POLE ENTERED A HOLE IN THE CEMENT.  TO REACH THIS STATION FROM MAUNABO, TAKE THE ROAD WHICH PASSES BETWEEN THE NEW CENTRAL SUGAR WORKS AND THE MAUNABO RIVER AND FOLLOW ALONG THIS UP THE RIVER VALLEY.  IT SHORTLY BECOMES A TRAIL, FIT ONLY FOR FOOT AND HORSE TRAVELERS, AND SHOULD BE FOLLOWED UNTIL IT CROSSES THE RIVER AT A POINT WHICH IS ABOUT 80 FEET BELOW A GREAT REEF OF STONES OVER WHICH THE WATER FALLS. CONTINUE BEYOND THIS CROSSING TO THE NEXT SUMMIT WHERE THE TRAIL WINDS OVER A RIDGE.  HERE WILL BE NOTED THREE HOUSES, TWO ON THE RIGHT AND ONE ON THE LEFT, PROPERTY OF SERIN COLON.  AT THIS POINT LEAVE THE TRAIL AND FOLLOW THE PATH, GOING STEEPLY UP THE HILL TO THE RIGHT.  THIS WILL BRING ONE TO THE HOUSE OF DOMINGO MORALES, AND THE TRAIL WILL BE FOUND TO LEAD STRAIGHT UP TO THE SUMMIT OF MORALES HILL, WHICH IT CROSSES, (BETWEEN THE BOULDERS) A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE STATION MARK.  IN LOOKING FOR THIS SIGNAL A STRANGER MAY BE TAKEN BY MISTAKE TO THE SIGNAL CALLED RAMON WHICH IS BETWEEN 1/2 AND 5/8 OF A MILE E OF MORALES.  RAMON IS ON A SUMMIT OF VERY LIMITED GRASSY AREA WITH NO CULTIVATION ABOUT IT.  IT IS ALSO DEVOID OF THE BOULDERS WHICH ARE SO NOTABLE A FEATURE ON MORALES, BESIDES RAMON IS ON A LOWER SUMMIT.  IT WAS BUILT FIRST BUT THROWN OUT BECAUSE IT COULD NOT BE SEEN FROM HELENA.  RAMON IS ON PROPERTY WHICH BELONGS TO SENOR FLORES RAMON.  IT WAS MARKED JUST AS MORALES WAS MARKED.",
